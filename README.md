## Introduce
AntRunner is a portable antenna rotator designed and made by Muse Lab. It can be used for real-time automatic racking of satellites with corresponding open source software which is available on Windows/Linux/Mac/RaspberryPi/Android. The rotator and the host computer can communicate via wired (serial port) or wireless (Wifi 2.4G).  It can install various types of antennas (usually Yagi antennas), support 360-degree azimuth and 180-degree elevation control, and can support antennas up to 5KG.  It can be powered by a 12V battery or by a fast charging power bank with a 12V fast charging trigger cable. Itâ€™s easy to carry as its weight is relatively light and very convenient to use in the wild for HAM.
